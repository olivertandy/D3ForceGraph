# D3ForceGraph
Force-directed graph to simulate network topology. Uses the D3 JavaScript library. The network is generated using D3's hierarchy class. The hue of each node is determined at the top level of the hierarchy and carries on down throug its descendants; size and saturation decrease as the hierarchy goes down.
